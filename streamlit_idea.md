# Streamlit App Idea

## Title: Wage Disparity Dashboard 

## Ideas 

1. **Wage Disparity Tool**: Allows users to select a contry and dynamically generates 2 charts: 
    - A chart showing disparity in wages between genders 
    - A chart showing disparity in wages between regions (urban or rural) 

2. **Trends Tool**: Users can select a country and a time period to visualize trends in wage disparity over time. This could include:
    - A line chart showing changes in gender wage disparity over the selected time period
    - A line chart showing changes in regional wage disparity (urban vs rural) over the selected time period

3. **Comparison Tool**: Users can select two countries to compare their wage disparities. The app will generate:
    - Line plots for each country selected with time on the x-axis and average wage on the y-axis
